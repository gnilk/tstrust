# Trying to learn Rust...

This implements the TestRunner in Rust, see: http://github.com/gnilk/testrunner

I wanted a project to test out Rust. The test-runner is fairly contained and contains
various interesting aspects (threads, interfacing with dynamically loaded libraries).

Plus, I can use the real version as a 'unit-test'.

## TO-DO List
* Dependency handling
* Better return codes (in quite a lot of places)
* Output formatting
* Nicer split in sub-modules
* Reporting
